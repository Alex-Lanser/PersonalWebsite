      <p>I am currently a Computer Engineering major senior attending MSOE.</p>
      <p>I have multiple summers of internship experience with skills in C, C++, Java, ARM Assembly, VHDL,
        Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.
      </p>
      <p>I am passionate about programming as there are so many different projects that can be done.
        I've had trouble deciding what I specifically wanted to do in the field, but I have skills for many
        careers like Front-End Development, Back-End Development, Embedded System Development, and more.

        <h3>Electronic Lock</h3>
        <img class="embedded" src="images/embedded.jpg" alt="Electronic Lock">
        <p>Embedded Systems at MSOE project on the MSOE STM32 micoprocessor development board.</p>
        <p>Ask the user to guess a 4-digit password. If the user guesses correctly, then a 'success' tune will play
          and the LEDs will do an 'unlock' pattern. If the user guesses incorrectly, then an 'incorrect' tune will play
          and the LEDs will flash. </p>
        <p>Developed ARM Assembly and C code to bring together the touchpad, LCD screen, LEDs, and speaker. Debugged
          successfully by going through registers to see what values are entering and exiting.</p>

        <p>Design of Operating Systems at MSOE C project.</p>
        <p>Simulate a park where 60 visitors will visit over a period of 60 seconds, but only 20 visitors
          can be in the park at a given time. Each visitor must obtain a ticket, go through the museum, board a tour
          car,
          go on the tour, enter the gift shop and then leave the park. Drivers must sell tickets to the visitors and
          drive the cars when they are full.</p>
        <p>Developed entirely in C. Uses threads and thread tasks to simulate each of the visitors, drivers, and cars.
          Uses mutex semaphores
          to protect critical sections of code, such as acquiring a driver to buy a ticket or to drive a car. Uses
          semaphores to communicate events
          between tasks, such as to awaken a driver or signal a mode change. Used resource semaphores to control access
          to the park, number of tickets
          available, and the number of people allowed in the gift shop and museum.</p>

          what
          a matrix should be depending on what the user wants to do (scale, rotate, change color).

        <h3>LED Scrolling Text at DDC</h3>
        <img class="scrolling" src="images/scrolling.jpg" alt="Scrolling Display">
        <p>At my second year internship with Digital Design Corporation.</p>
        <p>Prove that scrolling text is possible on their new RGB LED display that consisted of 8x8 LED matrices
          connected to form an
          8x2 rectangular display. This display will be used in the future Digital Design Corporation devices.</p>
        <p>Developed using python and a raspberry pi. Used installed libraries through a raspberry pi terminal and drove
          the display
          with the raspberry pi. Successfully debugged to ensure that the written tests worked correctly and proved that
          the scrolling
          text was possible to an extent. Later went on my own to figure out how to pull real time weather data using
          APIs and then
          display the data on the display.
