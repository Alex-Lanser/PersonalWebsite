        <p class="aboutMe">Originally from the Chicagoland area, I moved to Milwaukee in 2020 to pursue an education in Computer Engineering after taking a digital electronic class in high school.<br />
           I had a very hard decision originally, however, when choosing schools. I could go to MSOE, which is a strong engineering school, or I could go to Rose-Hulman, another strong engineering school <br />
           Milwaukee was my final choice because it was closer to home, and I felt that I fit in there more. <br />
           My first year was a good year, as I had met a good group of friends, and began to see what I could possibly be doing in the future. <br />
           It wasn't until my second year when I actually began to look forward to school, as it was finally in person again due to Covid-19 the year before. <br />
           I took embedded system classes throughout the whole year, where we learned how to code in C and ARM assembly. This is by far one of my favorite class I have taken so far. <br />
           I have also always been interested in web development, so I also took a class in the spring which was an introduction to web development. This class began to increase my interest more. <br />
           I am currently taking a front-end development course online, and am also learning about blockchains and blockchain development in Solidity.
