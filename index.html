      <p>Hi! I'm Alex Lanser!</p>
      <p>I am currently a Computer Engineering major senior attending MSOE.</p>
      <p>I have multiple summers of internship experience with skills in C, C++, Java, ARM Assembly, VHDL,
        Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL.
      </p>
      <p>I am passionate about programming as there are so many different projects that can be done.
        I've had trouble deciding what I specifically wanted to do in the field, but I have skills for many
        careers like Front-End Development, Back-End Development, Embedded System Development, fields in Cybersecurity, and more.

        <p>Embedded Systems at MSOE project on the MSOE STM32 micoprocessor development board.</p>
        <p>Ask the user to guess a 4-digit password. If the user guesses correctly, then a 'success' tune will play
          and the LEDs will do an 'unlock' pattern. If the user guesses incorrectly, then an 'incorrect' tune will play
          and the LEDs will flash. </p>
        <p>Developed ARM Assembly and C code to bring together the touchpad, LCD screen, LEDs, and speaker. Debugged
          successfully by going through registers to see what values are entering and exiting.</p>

        <p>Simulate a park where 60 visitors will visit over a period of 60 seconds, but only 20 visitors
          can be in the park at a given time. Each visitor must obtain a ticket, go through the museum, board a tour
          car,
          go on the tour, enter the gift shop and then leave the park. Drivers must sell tickets to the visitors and
          drive the cars when they are full.</p>
        <p>Developed entirely in C. Uses threads and thread tasks to simulate each of the visitors, drivers, and cars.
          Uses mutex semaphores
          to protect critical sections of code, such as acquiring a driver to buy a ticket or to drive a car. Uses
          semaphores to communicate events
          between tasks, such as to awaken a driver or signal a mode change. Used resource semaphores to control access
          to the park, number of tickets
          available, and the number of people allowed in the gift shop and museum.</p>

        <p>Developed using python and a raspberry pi. Used installed libraries through a raspberry pi terminal and drove

          with the raspberry pi. Successfully debugged to ensure that the written tests worked correctly and proved that
          the scrolling
          text was possible to an extent. Later went on my own to figure out how to pull real time weather data using
          APIs and then
          display the data on the display.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Going into MSOE, I was orignally an Electrical Engineering major as I had previously taken hardware classes in
        highschool
        and I had built my own PC. The summer before attending, I changed my major to Computer Engineering to get more
        software exposure
        and open up more opportunities for me in the future. I have since been focusing on software more than hardware,
        even to the point
        where I almost switched to Software Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>The reason why I applied to MSOE was because it was closer to my hometown in Illinois and it is one of the best
        engineering
        schools in the country. They are very hands on with weekly labs which is very important for me since I am a poor
        test taker.
        After visiting the campus for the first time, I knew I wanted to go because of the environment in and out of the
        class. Starting in 2020 at MSOE, I have been on the honors list multiple times and have obtained a GPA of 3.10.
      </p>
      <p>I have multiple summers of internship experience with the same company where I learned how to work as an
        engineer in the field, with one summer focusing on Electrical Engineering and another summer focusing of
        Software Development.
