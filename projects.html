            <strong>Number Guessing Game</strong>
            <br/>
            <span style="font-size:18px;">This was on the embedded system that we got
            as sophomore CE students. This specific project was to have the system show
            a binary number on the red LEDs. The user would then have to guess what that
            number was on the keypad. The system would then let the user know if their guess
            was correct or incorrect by playing a tone and printing to the LCD screen. After 
            5 rounds, the system would print to the LCD screen how many rounds the user won.<br/>

            <strong>Embedded System Lock</strong>

            <span style="font-size: 18px;">This was also on the embedded system that we got
            as sophomore CE students. This specific project was to create a lock that was
            put as a constant in the code and have the user guess the passcode. When the user
            guessed, the system will print to the LCD screen if the passcode was correct or not,
            play a certain tone, and flash the LED lights.<br/>
